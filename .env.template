# Environment Variables Template
# Copy this file to .env and fill in the required values

# ============================================
# REQUIRED - Application will fail without these
# ============================================

# Database Configuration
# For production, use a dedicated path outside the project directory
# Example: DATABASE_URL="file:/var/lib/analyzer-web/production.db"
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# NextAuth Configuration
# CRITICAL: Generate a secure random secret before deployment
# Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
# NEVER commit the actual secret to version control
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=

# NextAuth URL - Must match your production domain
# Example: NEXTAUTH_URL="https://reconcile.yourbank.com"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# ============================================
# OPTIONAL - Feature-specific configuration
# ============================================

# Gemini API (only if AI features are enabled)
# Leave empty if not using AI features
GEMINI_API_KEY=

# File Upload Configuration
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=50
UPLOAD_DIR="./uploads"

# ============================================
# DEPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT
# ============================================

# Set to "production" for production deployments
# This affects error handling, logging, and security headers
NODE_ENV="development"

# ============================================
# SECURITY NOTES
# ============================================

# 1. NEVER commit .env with actual secrets to version control
# 2. Use different secrets for development, staging, and production
# 3. Rotate secrets regularly (at least quarterly)
# 4. Store production secrets in a secure vault or secrets manager
# 5. Ensure NEXTAUTH_SECRET is at least 32 characters of random data
# 6. Use HTTPS in production (set NEXTAUTH_URL to https://)
# 7. Restrict file system permissions on .env file (chmod 600)

# ============================================
# BANKING COMPLIANCE
# ============================================

# For banking environments, ensure:
# - All secrets are managed through approved secrets management system
# - Environment variables are injected at runtime, not stored in files
# - Audit logging captures all configuration changes
# - Access to environment configuration is restricted and logged
